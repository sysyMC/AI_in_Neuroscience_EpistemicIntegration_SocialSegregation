# Epistemic integration and social segregation of AI in neuroscience

 This repository includes the original codes related to the study of the integration of AI in neuroscience (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01046). This work lies on a scientometric dataset including neuroscience papers published in journals both referenced by the Web of Science and SCImago Journal Rank, which has been extracted from MAG and which is entirely available on Zenodo (...).

Each notebook is named with a number, indicating the chronological order of execution:
1) `dataset_preparation.ipynb`: import the dataset of Zenodo, clean and pre-process the different databases, and compute some metrics which will be used in the following notebooks,
2) `citation_network_rankings.ipynb`: perform citational analysis of the whole neuroscience corpus,
3) `journals.ipynb`: study of the AI activity of the neuroscience journals and their related authors,
4) `author_collaboration_network.ipynb`: study of the neuroscientific collaboration network.
